# Project Name

A brief description of your project goes here. This project includes a Node.js server and a Python server, both running concurrently on separate ports to achieve [goal or functionality].

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- Python (v3.6+ recommended)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
   cd yourproject
   ```

2. **Install Node.js Dependencies**

   In the project directory, install the required Node.js packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Install Python Dependencies**

   Navigate to the directory with `server.py` and install any necessary Python dependencies, if applicable:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Note: Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file with all Python dependencies listed, or specify them here.

## Running the Application

1. **Run the Node.js Server**

   In one terminal window, start the Node.js server by executing:

   ```bash
   node app.js
   ```

   This should start the Node server on `http://localhost:<Node_server_port>`. By default, this port is set in `app.js`, so ensure it’s configured to your preferred port if necessary.

2. **Run the Python Server**

   In a separate terminal window, start the Python server by running:

   ```bash
   python3 server.py
   ```

   This will start the Python server on `http://localhost:<Python_server_port>`. Make sure this port differs from the Node.js server port to avoid conflicts.

## Accessing the Application

- **Node.js Server:** Go to `http://localhost:<Node_server_port>` in your browser.
- **Python Server:** Go to `http://localhost:<Python_server_port>` in your browser.

Both servers must be running simultaneously to enable the full functionality of the application.

## Configuration

- **Environment Variables:** If your app requires environment variables, create a `.env` file in the root directory and add necessary variables there, such as:

  ```env
  PORT=3000
  DB_CONNECTION_STRING=your_database_connection_string
  ```

- **Port Configuration:** If needed, adjust the ports in `app.js` and `server.py`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Port Conflicts:** If either server doesn’t start, ensure no other application is using the specified ports. Update the port in `app.js` or `server.py` if conflicts persist.
- **Dependency Errors:** For Node.js, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and re-running `npm install` if you encounter issues.
- **Python Dependencies:** If errors arise during `pip install`, ensure Python and pip are correctly installed and updated.
